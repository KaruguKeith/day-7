#this is a principle that allows you to protect properties of a class from external modification
#we enforce encapsulation through access modifiers
# in puthon if we dont specify the code treats is as 
# a single  _ before the variable name sets it as a protected variable
#a double _ before the variable name sets it as private attribute
#no _ it is public
#a protected attribuyte can be accesed by a child class but a private one cannot access it
